This tool automates the discovery of digital assets belonging to an organization, providing a comprehensive view of its digital footprint on the Internet.

## Features (MVP)

*   üîç **ASN Discovery**: Identifies autonomous systems (via BGP.HE.NET).
*   üåê **IP Range Mapping**: Lists network blocks announced by discovered ASNs (via BGP.HE.NET).
*   üîó **Domain/Subdomain Enumeration**: Finds domains and subdomains (via crt.sh) and checks basic DNS resolution status.
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Provider Detection**: Identifies potential cloud services based on known IP ranges (AWS, Azure, GCP) and domain patterns.
*   üìä **Basic Visualizations**: Includes an asset type distribution pie chart and ASN bar chart.
*   üìÑ **Reporting**: Export discovered assets to CSV (per asset type) or a consolidated Text report.
*   ‚ú® **Web Interface**: Interactive UI built with Streamlit.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
cd org-recon
    ```

2.  **Create and activate virtual environment (Python 3.13 required):**
    ```bash
    python3.13 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **(Optional) Install development dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
    ```

5.  **(Optional) Setup Environment Variables:**
    If any data sources require API keys in the future, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env 
    # Edit .env with your keys
    ```
    *Note: The current implementation primarily uses public sources that may not require keys, but this is good practice.* 

## Usage

1.  **Ensure the virtual environment is activated:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate 
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/app.py
    ```

3.  **Open your web browser** to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

4.  **Enter the Target Organization Name** in the sidebar.

5.  **(Optional) Enter known Base Domains** (one per line) to help focus the search.

6.  **Click "Start Scan"**.

7.  View the results in the different tabs and use the "Export Reports" tab to download data.

## Development & Testing

*   **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
*   **Code Style:** Adheres to PEP 8 (consider using `black` or `ruff` formatters).
